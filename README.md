# calculator
This is a simple javascript calculator app with no backend or framework.
The main point of this project was to practice DOM manipulation and simple animations, but I found the logic surprisingly more complex than it first appeared.
I used helper functions in order to follow the 'DRY' principle ('Don't Repeat Yourself').
